# Process-Metrics-for-DNN
Code for paper:How to Measure the Training Stage of Deep Learning Models: the Angle of  Process Metrics from Software Engineering

## Dependencies:

Code has been tested on:

* Python 3.6, 3.7
* OS: Windows 10
* GPU: RTX2060, RTX3060, RTX2080Ti, Tesla v100

### Pip
Use the following command to establish the environment:
```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Quick start

### Data Source

We use the dataset and models as same as paper: Correlations Between Deep Neural Network Model Coverage Criteria and Model Quality.
You can download data from their link:
* Google Drive mirror: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16w93LPkaF0AP9QxIty9Y6ipU-N4cbPUd?usp=sharing

You will find 3 zip files from the link, please download 'data.zip' only.
Unzip 'data.zip' and get three folders: 'cifar_data', 'mnist_data' and 'svhn_data'. Please put these three folders under the 'data' folder in the main folder. 

### Experiments
The experiment details are written in the README files of each folder.
